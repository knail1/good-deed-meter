# Good Deed Meter Implementation Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for the Good Deed Meter Android application. Each step is designed to be self-contained while building upon previous work in a logical sequence.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Foundation

### Step 1: Project Initialization
- Create a new Android project with Kotlin
- Configure build.gradle with required dependencies:
  - AndroidX Core and AppCompat
  - Material Design components
  - Room for database operations
  - Lifecycle components (ViewModel, LiveData)
  - Coroutines for asynchronous operations
  - Play Services Location for geofencing
  - Hilt for dependency injection (optional)
- Set up the basic application structure following MVVM architecture

### Step 2: Data Models and Database
- Implement the SQLite database schema as specified
- Create the Location and Visit data models
- Implement LocationDao and VisitDao interfaces
- Create the database helper class
- Write unit tests for database operations

### Step 3: Repository Layer
- Create repository classes for Locations and Visits
- Implement methods for data access and manipulation
- Add error handling for database operations
- Write unit tests for repository methods

## Phase 2: Core Functionality

### Step 4: Location Search Integration
- Implement the OpenStreetMap Nominatim API client
- Create the location search functionality
- Add error handling for network operations
- Implement the location selection and saving process

### Step 5: Geofencing Service
- Create the foreground service for geofencing
- Implement geofence registration logic
- Add geofence transition handling
- Implement the VisitLogger to record visits
- Add notification handling for foreground service

### Step 6: Visit Tracking Logic
- Implement the logic to track and count visits
- Add same-day visit counter functionality
- Create the visit recording mechanism
- Implement the background tracking toggle functionality

## Phase 3: User Interface

### Step 7: Onboarding and Permissions
- Create the onboarding screen
- Implement permission request handling
- Add permission state management
- Create UI for permission rationale

### Step 8: Dashboard UI
- Implement the Dashboard fragment layout
- Create the statistics view components
- Add the background tracking toggle
- Implement period selection dropdown (week/month/year)
- Create the last visit display

### Step 9: Add Location UI
- Implement the Add Location fragment
- Create the address input form
- Add the search results display
- Implement the location confirmation UI

### Step 10: History UI
- Create the History fragment
- Implement the visit history list
- Add the CSV export functionality
- Create the visit detail display

## Phase 4: Integration and Refinement

### Step 11: Navigation and Main Activity
- Implement the bottom navigation
- Set up the navigation graph
- Create the MainActivity to host fragments
- Add transitions between screens

### Step 12: Error Handling and Edge Cases
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Add geofence limit handling
- Create UI for error states
- Implement permission revocation handling

### Step 13: Data Export
- Implement the CSV export functionality
- Add file writing to Downloads directory
- Create the export mapping logic
- Add error handling for export operations

### Step 14: Testing and Optimization
- Write instrumentation tests
- Perform battery usage optimization
- Test geofence trigger reliability
- Optimize database queries
- Test on various Android versions

### Step 15: Final Polishing
- Add the styled header text
- Implement accessibility features
- Perform UI refinements
- Add final error handling
- Complete documentation

## Implementation Notes

- Each step should be completed and tested before moving to the next
- Commit code after each step is completed and tested
- Each step should result in a functional (though incomplete) application
- Focus on quality and correctness rather than speed
- Follow Android best practices throughout implementation
